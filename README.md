# iris-classification

The iris dataset classification problem also known as a Hello world!! program in the world of Data Science. The iris dataset is analaysed, visualised and prediction model is built using the supervised machine learning algorithm. Aim of the project is to classify the iris flower.  

Follow the steps given below:

1. Load the iris dataset in R studio. The data is available in the R studio itself, no need to download the dataset explicitly.
2. Summarizing the dataset.
3. Visualizing the dataset.
4. Evaluating the algorithms.
5. Predict the model.
